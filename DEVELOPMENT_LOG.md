# TypeStorm Development Log

## âœ… Phase 1: Architecture Design (Completed)
- Designed comprehensive system architecture with WebGPU-first approach
- Created modular preset/layout system with clean separation of concerns
- Defined core API: `applyPreset(text, presetName, options)`
- Established performance optimization strategy with 60fps target
- Designed fallback systems for WebGPU â†’ WebGL â†’ Canvas

## âœ… Phase 2: Technical Research (Completed)
- Researched GSAP 3 + Three.js integration patterns (2025 updates)
- Investigated WebGPU text rendering with SDF approach
- Analyzed canvas video export pipeline with CCapture.js + ffmpeg.wasm
- Collected shader patterns for all 5 preset types
- Documented mobile performance considerations

## âœ… Phase 3: Project Bootstrap (Completed)
- Initialized Vite-React TypeScript project with all dependencies
- Created exact folder structure per specification
- Set up complete tech stack: Three.js, GSAP, OpenType.js, p5.js, CCapture.js
- Configured ESLint + Prettier development environment
- Created skeleton files for all presets and layouts

## âœ… Phase 4: Core Engine Implementation (Completed)
- Implemented TextEngine.ts with full TypeScript support and API
- Built complete layout system integration with mathematical precision
- Set up advanced Three.js scene management with WebGPU fallbacks

## âœ… Phase 5: Animation Presets (Completed)
- Neon Flicker: Electric glow effects with particles and bloom
- Liquid Flow: Advanced fluid simulation with realistic physics
- Fire/Plasma: Realistic flame effects with ember particles and heat distortion
- Glitch-Type: Digital corruption with RGB separation and datamoshing
- Variable-Font Morph: Dynamic font variation morphing with smooth transitions

## âœ… Phase 6: Layout Engine (Completed)
- Spiral Layout: Archimedean, logarithmic, and Fibonacci spirals
- Radial Layout: Perfect circular positioning with multiple distribution algorithms
- Grid Layout: Flexible arrangements including hexagonal and organic patterns

## âœ… Phase 7: Video Capture System (Completed)
- CCapture.js + ffmpeg.wasm integration for high-quality exports
- MP4, WebM, and GIF format support with 1080x1920 vertical video
- Real-time progress tracking and memory management
- Platform-specific optimizations for TikTok/Instagram compatibility

## âœ… Phase 8: CLI Interface (Completed)
- Built complete CLI with npm run reel command
- Headless browser automation using Puppeteer for rendering
- Interactive and batch modes with full option support
